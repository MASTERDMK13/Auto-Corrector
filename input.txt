Wht is ML?
Macine leaarning (ML) is a branch of artifical intellince (AI) and couter science that focuses on the using data and alorithms to enable AI to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

How does machine learning work?
UC Beeley (link resides outside ibm.com) breaks out the learning system of a machine learning algorithm into three main parts.

A Dfdecision Process: In general, machine learning algorithms are used to make a predicton or classification. Based on some input data, which can be labeled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data.
An Error Function: An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If there are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model.
A Model Opxvtimization Process: If the model can fit bter to the data points in the training set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the model estimate. The algorithm will repeat this iterative “evaluate and optimize” process, updating weights autonomously until a threshold of accuracy has been met.
